# June 2020 nteract Release

## nteract Desktop App

This month's release of the nteract desktop app contains a brand-new UI featuring:
* an app-level toolbar
* a file sidebar
* a new cell UX
* a new command prompt (activated by pressing <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</p>)

Over the comings months, we will be building on top of this new UX with:
- support for opening multiple notebooks in the same menu
- support for configuring keyboard shortcuts
- and more!

In addition to the new UI, the following changes have been shipped:
- Support for automatically loading syntax highlighting for programming languages
- Bug fix for issue where config changes were not persisted beyond a single sessions

## nteract Core SDK

The following changes have been shipped to the Core SDK. If you are using one of the packages listed below as a transitive
dependency, you will need to update its parent package.

### @nteract/commutable (v7.3.0)
- Skip reformatting output bundle when serializing notebook document (https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/5146)

### @nteract/core (v15.0.0)
- **(Breaking Change)** Move `comms` entities list into `core.entities`
    - If you are referring to the `comms` state using nteract's selectors and epics, you will not need to migrate any code.
    - if you have hard-coded references to `state.comms`, these will need to be updated to `state.core.entities.comms`.
- **(Breaking Change)**  Deprecate `config` state in favor of `mythic-configurations` package
    - To use the package, either:
        * use the `makeConfigureStore` function from `@nteract/myths`:
            ```typescript
            import {configuration} from "@nteract/mythic-configuration";
            import {makeConfigureStore} from "@nteract/myths";
        
            type NonPrivateState = { foo: string };
            const configureStore = makeConfigureStore<NonPrivateState>()({
            packages: [
                configuration,
            ],
            // reducers, epics, etc.
            });
            export const store = configureStore({ foo: "bar" });
            ```
        * or call `configuration.rootReducer(state, action)` in your reducer and add the return value of `configuration.makeRootEpic()` to your epics.     
    - Dispatch the return value of `setConfigFile(<path>)` to make it load/write/watch a config file instead.
    - To define configuration options, use `defineConfigOption(...)`:
        ```typescript
        import {defineConfigOption} from "@nteract/mythic-configuration";
        
        export const {
        selector: tabSize,
        action: setTabSize,
        } = defineConfigOption({
        label: "Tab Size",
        key: "codeMirror.tabSize",
        values: [
            {label: "2 Spaces", value: 2},
            {label: "3 Spaces", value: 3},
            {label: "4 Spaces", value: 4},
        ],
        defaultValue: 4,
        });
        ```
    - You can then use the selector (e.g. `tabSize` above) to get the value from a store (e.g. `tabSize(store.getState())`).
    - You can then alter the state by dispatching the result of the action function (e.g. `setTabSize` above, `store.dispatch(setTabSize(4))`).
    - If you have a group of config options with a common prefix (e.g. `codemirror.<...>`), you can get a selector for the whole group with `createConfigCollection(...)`:
        ```typescript
        import {createConfigCollection} from "@nteract/mythic-configuration";
        
        const codeMirrorConfig = createConfigCollection({
        key: "codeMirror",
        });
        ```
        You can then do something like `codeMirrorConfig(store.getState())` to get something like
        ```javascript
        {
        tabSize: 4,
        // ... other options starting with `codemirror.`, potentially nested if more than one dot 
        }
        ```
    - The state is stored under `__private__.configuration` in the store, but it shouldn't be neccessary to directly access it.
    - To type the state/store you can use `HasPrivateConfigurationState`.
    - If you need a different way of persisting the config, you can set your own backend, e.g.:
        ```typescript
        // Since the cats are typically lazing about the computer, let's utilize them to store our
        // config...
        const catConfigurationBackend = (whichCats: Cat[]) => ({
        setup: () =>
            // Is called when the config system initialises, should return an Observable<Action>,
            // generally using the loadConfig myth to specify when the config should be loaded.
            concat(
            of("immediately"),
            interval(10 * 60 * 1000),
            ).pipe(
            tap(_ => wakeUpCats(whichCats)),
            mapTo(loadConfig.create()),
            ),
            
        load: () =>
            // Is called to load config, should return an Observable<Action>, generally using
            // the setConfig and/or setConfigAtKey myths to determine the config.
            askTheCatsAboutTheirConfigOptions(whichCats).pipe(
            mapErrorTo(undefined, error => error?.complaint === "HUNGRY"),
            skipWhile(data => data === undefined),
            map(setConfig.create),
            ),
        
        save: (current: Map<string, any>) =>
            // Is called with the current config object to save it after it changed, should return an
            // Observable<Action>, which should be empty unless you need to dispatch actions on save.
            tellTheCatsToRememberConfigOptions(current.toJSON(), whichCats).pipe(
            ignoreElements(),
            ),
        } as ConfigurationBackend);
        
        export const setConfigCats = (whichCats: Cat[]) =>
        setConfigBackend.create(catConfigurationBackend(whichCats));
        
        // Now just do store.dispatch(setConfigCats(...)) to start using it and hope the cats have good
        // memory and feel like cooperating...
        ```

### @nteract/editor (v10.1.0)
- Add support for automatically loadign CodeMirror modes for languages (https://github.com/nteract/nteract/pull/5123)
